# Counter-Function-JS

Write a JavaScript function that takes a string argument and calculates the following:

Number of words
Number of letters
Number of spaces
Total number of characters
Average word length
Test case

superCounter("Count me in!");
would count 3 words, 9 letters, 2 spaces, 12 characters, avg word length of 3, and 2 spaces.

Return output as a single object, and don't use any libraries.

Example output:

console.log( superCounter("Count me in!" );
// outputs {"words": 3, "letters": 9, "spaces": 2, "chars": 12, "avgLength": 3, "spaces": 2}
